# Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction

A reproducible CTR prediction pipeline for the Kaggle Avazu dataset.  This repo trains a baseline click-through-rate model from `train.csv`, evaluates it on a validation split, and generates a Kaggle-style submission from `test.csv`.  The current baseline uses Logistic Regression with preprocessing for numeric and categorical features. This repository was originally generated from the notebook **Click Through Rate Prediction Final Submission.ipynb** and organized into a Python package + CLI scripts.
You can keep the original notebook under `notebooks/` and iterate on the modular code in `src/` and `scripts/`.

# Summary 

Uses the Avazu CTR Kaggle dataset
Builds a pipeline to:
load and downsample / preprocess high-cardinality categorical features
train a CTR model (LogReg / GBDT / etc.)
evaluate on a validation set using CTR-specific metrics
generate a Kaggle-submittable CSV

## Dataset (Avazu CTR Prediction)

~40M training samples
Highly sparse categorical features
Binary classification (clicked vs not clicked)
Challenges:
Extreme class imbalance
Very high-cardinality categorical variables
Need for efficient feature encoding

Competition: Avazu Click-Through Rate Prediction (Kaggle)

Download `train.csv` and `test.csv` from the competition page and place them here:

data/raw/train.csv
data/raw/test.csv

## Quickstart


This repository was generated from the notebook **Click Through Rate Prediction Final Submission.ipynb** and organized into a Python package + CLI scripts.
You can keep the original notebook under `notebooks/` and iterate on the modular code in `src/` and `scripts/`.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/train.py --csv data/raw/train.csv --label click
python scripts/predict.py --model models/model.joblib --input data/raw/test.csv --output predictions.csv
```

## Notes

- The baseline pipeline uses **Logistic Regression** over a simple preprocessing of numeric/categorical columns.
- Swap in gradient-boosting models (XGBoost/LightGBM) if your notebook relied on them; just update `src/model.py`.
- Keep iterating: move stable logic out of the notebook into `src/` functions.
